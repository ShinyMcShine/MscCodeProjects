# MScCodeProjects
These set of code snippets were code that I've written for various MSc. Data Science projects for my degree. 


################ AI ################
1. PE_API_PE.py was the class I wrote for our Chabot to predicted a customerâ€™s train delay scenario. 
 Providing the Chabot with the estimated time told by the train operator, their platform, and 
 Final destination.
 
 ################ Applications Programming ################
 1. The Java files in media player is the source code for a GUI media player I had based on 
 Object-oriented principals. If you would like a copy of the free licenced music and album 
 covers, along with the .Jar file to run the application please contact me.


################# Dissertation #########################
1. My Dissertation was to improve classification of EEG data know to have low to noise signal ratio as well limited datasets. This block of code located in "EEG_image_processing_classification" folder details the work I performed in image processing, to capture event related potentials (ERP) and time-frequency representations (TFR) using signal processing techniques such as Fourier transform and wavelets. 
2. For full disclosure the method of PCA used in ML and classification proved to be no better than chance with this method used as well as using the entire image as a feature vector. PCA method used was based on eigenvalue/vectors. 
3. However, I've continued my work and have come up with a new method to improve classification and an Abstract has been officially submitted (Dec 18th 2019) to 2020 Organization for Human Brain Mapping annual conference. This code has not been included yet pending response of abstract.
4. Each folder within the root has a readme.txt file with some information about the files within.
