# MScCodeProjects
These set of code snippets were code that I've written for various MSc. Data Science projects for my degree. 


################ Artifical Intelligence ################
1. PE_API_PE.py was the class I wrote for our Chabot to predicted a customerâ€™s train delay scenario. 
 Providing the Chabot with the estimated time told by the train operator, their platform, and 
 Final destination.
 
 ################ Applications Programming #############
 1. The Java files in media player is the source code for a GUI media player I had based on 
 Object-oriented principals. If you would like a copy of the free licenced music and album 
 covers, along with the .Jar file to run the application please contact me.


################# Computer Vision ######################
1. Within "ComputerVision_image_classification" folder is my code used for an image classification problem utilising various feature selection methods and classifiers. Please check out the README within this folder if you care to execute. Also a copy of the best results confusion matrix and presentation of the work submitted showcasing our results and methods. 

################# Dissertation #########################
1. My Dissertation was to improve classification of EEG data, known to have low noise to signal ratio as well limited datasets. This block of code located in "EEG_image_processing_classification" folder details the work I performed in image processing, to capture event related potentials (ERP) and time-frequency representations (TFR) using signal processing techniques such as Fourier transform and wavelets. 
2. For full disclosure the method of PCA used in ML and classification proved to be no better than chance with this method used as well as using the entire image as a feature vector. PCA method used was based on eigenvalue/vectors. 
3. However, I've continued my work and have come up with a new method to improve classification and an Abstract has been officially submitted (Dec 18th 2019) to Organization for Human Brain Mapping annual 2020 conference. This code has not been included yet pending response of abstract.
4. Each folder within the root has a readme.txt file with some information about the files within.

#### NOTE ####
All of the code written here has been done by myself with the exception of files within Computer Vision as this was a duo project. The other author is Liam Self. If you decide to use any of this code please cite myself and both Liam and myself if you are using the code from "ComputerVision_image_classification". Thank you.
