The following is a descrtipon of the files use:

svm_classify.m - VLFeat SVM classifier used for entire image feature vector

SVM_andHyperParam.m - MATLAB SVM with Hyperparameter options as well as saving the results of each test and figure 
1. to run this you would first need to load the Eigen Features from the .mat file
2. Adjust the PC variable in SVM_andHyperParam
3. There are two sections the top one will change a model for a subject and the other half will run all subjects. They are serparated by the %% syntax
